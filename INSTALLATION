If you are seeing this file in the code, then you have the source
rather than the object version of RNetica.  

The current version does not automatically download the Netica API,
you need to download and unzip it yourself.  You also need to point
the installation at the place where it is located.

The current latest versions are:
Linux:  https://norsys.com/downloads/NeticaAPI_Linux_607.zip
Windows: https://norsys.com/downloads/NeticaAPI_Win_510.zip
MacOS: https://norsys.com/downloads/NeticaAPI_Mac.zip
or https://norsys.com/downloads/NeticaJ_MacOSX10.7_504.zip


Linux and MacOS X.  The appropriate libnetica.so file from the Netica
tarball needs to be copied into a directory where R can find it when
loading.  Under Ubuntu 18.04, the choices seem to be /usr/lib,
/usr/share/lib, and ${R_HOME}/lib.

=====================================

As of 2020, Norsys is making available a version 6.07 of the API,
currenlty only out for Linux, but probably available soon for MacOS
and Windows.  There are some slight difference in the header files and
shared library locations between the two, so it is necessary for the
configuration file to pickup which version you are using.

The best way to do this is using the pkg-config mechanism.  This works
on all three platforms, but may need to be installed.

I have included a netica.pc config file, this should be (a) edited so
the first line points to where the Netica API lives (in my case in a
directory under my home directory) and then (b) moved to somewhere
where pkg-config can find it.  (If pkg-config is configured correctly,
then `pkg-config --variable=pc_path pkg-config` should reveal the
localtion of the pkg-config packages.

The file netica504.pc is for the older version of the API (still most
recent for MacOS and Windows).  If you are using that version, then
rename the files (so it will be easy to replace when you upgrade).
Netica_5.04 is not recommended because of the bug in the absorb nodes
function, but it is still necesary until Norsys releases new
versions of the DLL/shared library for Windows/MacOS.

================================================================

These describe the older mechanism, now replaced by pkg-config.

On Linux and Unix (including Mac OS X) distributions you do that with
the "--with-netica" switch to configure.  Thus I compile with

R CMD INSTALL RNetica --configure-args='--with-netica=/home/ralmond/software/Netica_API_504'

To check I run with

R CMD check RNetica --install-args="--configure-args='--with-netica=/home/ralmond/software/Netica_API_504'"

For Windows installations, set an environmental variable NETICA_HOME
with the path in which you unpacked the Netica API.  R will give a
warning about manual configuration, this is the necessary manual
configuration. 

===================================================


If you have obtained a valid Netica API license key from Norsys, you
can insert it in the variable NeticaLicenseKey in the main workspace.
RNetica will then consult this value when loading the Netica DLL.  All
of the functions in the man pages work in the unlicensed version, so R
CMD check RNetica does not require a license key.

As of version 0.6, the startup mechanism now requires the program to
explicitly call:
sess <- NeticaSession()
startSession(sess)

In particular, this exposes the session object which contains
references to all available networks.  The licence key can be passed
as an optional argument to NeticaSession:
sess <- NeticaSession(LicenseKey=NeticaLicenceKey).

I've been keeping the license key in a file NeticaLicense.R in my home
directory, which I source at the begining of each session.
