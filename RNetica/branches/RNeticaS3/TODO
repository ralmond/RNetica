FALSE-node bug (Netica Node object is replaced with FALSE).
Nasty bug where RReference gets overwritten in network.  Not sure
where this is coming from, as they should be preserved.
      Nodelist <- NetworkNodesInSet(LevelMotif,"EMVars")
      NodeName(Nodelist$LeverTrohies) <- "LeverTrophies"
The corresponding element of the list is now FALSE and
    NetworkFindNode(LevelMotif,"LeverTrophies")
returns FALSE.
I'm having trouble reproducing this with a small example.  Maybe some
interaction with the garbage collector?  I've added a check for bad
object caches in the Net/Node/UserData field, now check to make sure
the returned object is of the right class, and if not recreates it.  I
wish I could more reliably reproduce the bugs so I can see if this
fixed the problem.
UPDATE:  I've made some changes that may fix this.  I've also now run
a couple of times using CHECK --gc-torture and not found the problem.
It may be fixed.

R stack error in BN_SetNodeProbs when passed a matrix of NA's as
probability table.

Parse the junction tree report

I'm getting an error GetError_ns:  deleted or damage report_ns passed
under Windows, 32-bit.  The condition that seemed to trigger this was
compiling a network with uninitialized CPTs (which generates a
warning).  This works correctly under Linux and Windows-64 bit.  The
error seems to persist after it was first encountered.

Seg fault if CreateNetwork_bn() is called with a null environment.
(Thanks to Elise Bethany Gould for spotting this).



Functions for
##   ReorderNodeStates, RemoveNodeState,
These seem to be redundant with current definition of NodeStates<-
## Update.  Folded AddNodeStates and RemoveNodeState into
## NodeStates<-.  Reorder Node States does something to the CPT, so
## There still might be a use for it.

Learning from Data (Both of these depend on Netica API updates)
## LearnCPTs -- update when Netica Fixes bugs
## Test Case streams with LearnCPTs and LearnFindings

Equations
  Equation Suppot is currently pretty minimal.  Probably not important
  as it is easier to build CPTs in R than use equations.

Continuous Node support
Decision Net support
##   EnterGaussianFinding,
##   EnterIntervalFinding,
    These two functions are giving unexpected results.  Query out to
    Norsys about this, i.e., they always give weight 1 to a single
    state, rather than distributiong the output over a number of
    states as expected.
     These two functions return NA in stituations where I'm expecting
     a numeric value or a state.
##   CalcNodeState, CalcNodeValue,
##    GetNodeExpectedUtils,
   Seems to be generating an internal Netica error.

Testing
## NewNetTester_bn, DeleteNetTester_bn, TestWithCaseset_bn
## GetTestConfusion_bn, GetTestErrorRate_bn, GetTestLogLoss_bn
## GetTestQuadradicLoss_bn
## TestWithCaseset_bn, 

Random Generation
Random generation implemented and tested, but probably very
inefficient in the simple case were we want to generate a set of
several hundred cases to a case file.  Should reimplement that on the
C side so we don't need to constantly do the R->c conversions.

DBNs
## ExpandNet_bn, SetNodeInputDelay_bn, SetNodePersistance_bn
There are currently no corresponding Get functions for these.

Do Not implement
#       NetworkUndo, NetworkRedo  # These don't do anything sensible.
##  SetLearnerRandomGen_bn #This is for future expasion (MCMC?)
Database Connectivity
##  NewDBManager_cs, DeleteDBManager_cs
##  InsertFindingsIntoDB_bn, AddDBCasesToCaseset_cs
##  ExcecuteDBSql_cs, AddNodesFromDB_bn
##  WriteCaseset_ns (The only use for this function is in conjunction
##  with the database stuff.)
