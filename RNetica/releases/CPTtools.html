<h1>About CPTtools</h1>
<p>
A Bayesian network is built from a set of variables aranged
in an acyclic directed graph.  For each variable, the conditional
probability distribution of that variable given its parents in the
graph.  For a discrete network, this takes the form of a conditional
probability table (CPT).
<p>
If the experts specify the table directly, the number of values to be
specified is exponential in the number of parents.  For this reason,
various parametric forms for the conditional probability tables have
been developed, in which the number of values to be specified is
usually linear in the number of parents.  This package collects R code
for generating the CPTs for these various parametric forms.
<p>
The second type of tool contained in the package is tools for
analyzing the output of Bayesian networks.  This includes both graphs
for displayig multiple conditional probabilities, and graphs for
analyzing sequences of evidence.
<p>
The tools here were originally developed to be used with StatShop (a
proprietary Bayes net scoring engine developed at ETS), but have been
adapted to work with RNetica.  There is no dependence on RNetica, the
tools here could be easily used (perhaps with some minor adaptation)
with other Bayesian network packages.

<h2>CPTtools License Information</h2>

<p>
CPTtools is made available under
  the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/Artistic-2.0">Artistic
  License, version 2.0</a>.

<h2>Current Version Status</h2>

The current version (0.2-3) includes both various distribution
building functions from the DiBello-Samejima family and various plots 
based on our paper <i>Bayesian networks:  a Teacher's View</i>.
Some functions for noisy-and models are included but not fully
debugged.

Note the source versions have been compiled and tested under
Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Windows.  As this is written purely in R, no
software other than R is required to install this package, and the
source package should install on all platforms.

<h2>Development Version</h2>

The latest development version is available as a subversion repository
at:  <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/CPTtools/">https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/CPTtools/</a>.
