<h1>About Peanut and PNetica</h1>
<p>
Peanut (a corruption of parameterized network, or Pnet) is a an object
oriented layer designed to rest on top
of <a href="CPTtools.html">CPTtools</a>.  In particular, it introduces
a parameterized node (Pnode) class that can associates the parameters of the
discrete partial credit models with the node object and a
parameterized network (Pnet) class that contains a collection of
parameterized nodes.  The figure below givens the object model.

<p>
The most important method in the class is the GEMfit method, which
uses the generalized EM algorithm to the CPTs for the parameterized
nodes to a set of cases.  It may offer other capabilities as it
evolveds.  
<p>
In order to keep the dependencies on a specific Bayes net package to a
minimum, they were isolated in a separate package.  The Peanut package
defines a series of functions and the PNetica package provides methods
for objects of the NeticaBN and NeticaNode classes (both from
the <a href="RNetica.html">RNetica</a> package).  The idea is similar
to the relationship between the DBI and RMySQL packages.
<p>
  I presented information about Peanut and PNetica at the UAI workshop
  in 2015.  The offical paper is published
  in <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1565/bmaw2015_paper4.pdf">CEUR
  volume 1565, paper 4</a>.  Slides for the talk are available here
  (<a http="DIRT-talk.pdf">PDF</a>). 

<h2>Peanut and PNetica License Information</h2>

<p>
Peanut and PNetica are made available under
  the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/Artistic-2.0">Artistic
    License, version 2.0</a>.  PNetica depends on RNetica, which has a
  somewhat more complex <a href="RNetica.html#License">license</a>.


<h2>Current Version Status</h2>
<p>
The current version (0.1-3) has been tested on simple models and
contains a users manual for both Peanut and PNetica.  There is
currently some difficulty in the parameter recovery tests, but this
may be due to limited size of the model.

If you have patches or other correspondence about Peanut you can
contact me at <a href="mailto:almond@acm.org">almond@acm.org<a/>.  If
you are filing a bug report, please be sure to include:
<ol>
<li> The version number of Peanut and R that you are using.
<li> Your operating system and whether it is 64 or 32 bit.
<li> The exact text of any error message that is generated.
<li> A small script that reproduces the problem (if at all possible).
</ol>
<p>
I would also be willing to host alternatives to PNetica using other
Bayes net packages on this server (either Web or Subversion).  Contact
me for details.
