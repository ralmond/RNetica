<h1>About RGA Utils</h1>
<p>
This started as a collection of small snippets of R code that I kept
copying from project to project.  Much of it started life in one of
the packages that eventually went
into <a href="CPTtools.html">CPTtools</a>, but I thought it might be
useful beyond that.
<p>
Then I started getting interested in the use
of <a href="#Beaton1964">Al Beaton's</a> sweep 
operator in missing data problems.  I found that the Beaton's sweep
operator (different from the built-in R/S <code>sweep</code> function)
was not readily available in any R package.  I started building that
and other matrix operators found in <a href="Dempster1969">Dempster's
    1969 book</a> on multivariate statistics.  (I found a couple of
typographical errors in some of the examples, which are fully
re-created in the examples distributed with the package).
<p>
I also noticed that
although <a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> had a
categorcial distribution, R did not have one built-in.  So I added
that to this collection as well.

<h2>Key functions</h2>
This package is a loose collection of hopefully useful functions.
Here are some key functions that can be used as a starting point for
exploring the package:
<dl>
  <dt>BQreg</dt><dd>This performs a regression restricted by
  a <i>Q</i>-matrix, a logical matrix indicating which coefficients
  should be non-zero.  It handles weights and missing data.</dd>
  <dt>Categorical</dt><dd>This provides <code>rcat</code>
  and <code>dcat</code> functions for nominal categorical data as
  well as <code>docat, pocat, qocat</code> and <code>rocat</code>
  functions for ordered categorical data.  It also provides
  a <code>median.ordered</code> method for ordered factors.</dd>
  <dt>colorspread</dt><dd>This produces an array of colors that
  differ by staturation or saturation and value, and not by hue.
  This is good for producing graphs that both look good in color and
  retain their legibility when printed in grayscale.</dd>
  <dt>dgetFromString</dt><dd>This is a serialization function for R
  objects. </dd>
  <dt>matSweep</dt><dd>This is Al Beaton's sweep operator, which
  regresses out variables in a normal distribution.  It also provides
  an interative method for inverting a matrix.</dd>
  <dt>numericPart</dt><dd>This separates numeric and non-numeric
  columns in a data frame.</dd>
  <dt>SSX</dt><dd>This produces a matrix of sums and sums of squares
  from weighted data.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>RGAUtils Talks and Papers</h2>

<a href="BQregTalk.pdf">Here</a> are slide for the presentation I gave
at the Florida Educational Research Assoication conference in 2016.

<h2>RGAutils License Information</h2>

<p>
RGAutils is made available under
  the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/Artistic-2.0">Artistic
  License, version 2.0</a>.

<h2>Current Version Status</h2>

The current version (0.1-4) is mostly debugged and documentation

Also included in the new version are R datasets corresponding
to <a href="http://ecd.ralmond.net/ecdwiki/ACED/ACED">ACED</a>. 

<h1>CPTtools Releases</h1>

The following releases are archived here:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Release</th><th>Source</th><th>Windows Binary</th><th>Mac Binary</th><th>Manual</th><th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.1-4</td><td><a href="CPTtools0.1-4.tar.gz">RGAutils_0.1-4.tar.gz</a></td>
<td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Early alpha release</td></tr>
</table>
  
Currenty, all of the code is written in pure R, so the source code
version should install cleanly on all systems. (If installing from
the R menus, you need to select "Install source package...")

<h2>Development Version</h2>

The latest development version is available as a subversion repository
at:  <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RGAutils/">https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RGAutils/</a>.  
<p>
If you have patches or other correspondence about RGAutils you can
contact me at <a href="mailto:almond@acm.org">almond@acm.org<a/>.  If
you are filing a bug report, please be sure to include:
<ol>
<li> The version number of CPTtools and R that you are using.
<li> Your operating system and whether it is 64 or 32 bit.
<li> The exact text of any error message that is generated.
<li> A small script that reproduces the problem (if at all possible).
