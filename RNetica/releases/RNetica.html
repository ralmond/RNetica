<h1>About RNetica</h1>
<p>
RNetica is best thought of as a "glue" layer between the open source
statistical programing language
R <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>
and the proprietary Bayesian network engine
Netica &reg; <a href="http://www.norsys.com">http://www.norsys.com/</a>.
Although there are some minor extensions to the Netica API, the
primary purpose of RNetica is to provide a binding for the Netica API
functions inside of R.  
<p>
There are two big advantages to this.  One is that while the Netica
GUI is helpful for model development, entering evidence by point and
click is cumbersome for real work.  Embedding the Netica API within R
means that R can be used for data preparation and cleaning, the data
can be entered into a model developed with the Netica GUI and the
results extracted and graphed using the graphical power of R.  The
second big advantage is that R is an interpreted language, which
supports rapid improvisation of code.  This make it substantially
faster to work in RNetica than using the C or Java APIs.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
I recently did a demonstration of RNetica for my Bayes net class and
recorded it using Tegrity.  I'm posting a few of those resources here
as a way of getting started.
<ul>
<li> The <a href="https://tegr.it/y/1ijsr">Tegrity recording</a> and
  the slightly edited <a href="RNetica.txt">R transcript</a>.
<li>The Slides used for the talk.  Note that these were revised an
  expanded after the class and now contain lots of additional
  material, including an index of RNetica functions grouped by topic.
  (<a href="RNetica.pptx">PowerPoint</a>, <a href="RNetica.pdf">PDF</a>).
<li> A sample RNetica script for restoring a network after restarting
  R.  (<a href="irt5.R">irt5.R</a>)  Note:  this uses one of the
  RNetica sample scripts (in the sampleNets folder after you install
  RNetica).  
<li> A sample RNetica script for building a Network and doing some
  inference.  (<a href="irt3.R">irt3.R</a>)  The network built by the
  script is here (<a href="irt5.R">irt5.R</a>).
</ul>

<h2>News</h2>
Started the 0.4 series of releases includes the following
improvements:
<ol>
<li> Added the functions MutualInfo, NodeExpectedValue and
  VarianceOfReal (user request, plus close to the top of my personal
  list). 
<li> Minimal support for equation.  (I find
  the <a href="CPTtools.html">CPTtools</a> easier to use for
  manipulating conditional probability tables.)
<li> Added more functions for decision nets, although these are not
  currently working (support request in to Norsys).
<li> A few other functions related to calcuating values and interval
  and Gaussian findings.  Again, these are not working in the 0.4-1
  version and a help request to Norsys is pending.
<li> Added some random findings generation code.  
<li> Cleaned up the behavior of as.IDname() so that it makes shorter
  names and is properly vectorized.
<li> Fixed some minor errors and problems with error handling.
</ol>
<p>
The 0.3 series of releases includes a number of different improvements.
<ol>
<li> I now how official permission to distribute binary versions from
  Norsys.  (You may want to still download and compile from sources
  you need the latest version of the API.)
<li> RNetica now passes the self-test
  under <code>gctorture(TRUE)</code>, which should mean that is it is
  much more robust to memory errors.  This is still a beta version,
  caution is still advisable.
<li><i>Update</i>It now has case file support and includes support for learning
  conditional probability tables 
<li> I've moved my development and testing platform to R 3.0.1.
  Binaries are build for R version 3.x.
<li><i>Update</i> The version 0.3 cycle is more or less complete,
  except that I'm waiting for API updates from Norsys in response to
  problems. 
</ol>
<p> Known issues with this release.</p>
<ol>
<li> There is currently no way through the Netica API to check whether
  EM and Gradient decent learning converged or timed out due to the
  maximum number of iterations being reached.
<li> Currently, memory streams cannot be used with the LearnCPTs
  functions.  This appears to be a Netica problem.
<li> As I'm going through the compile cycle, I'm running into some
  errors under Windows related to generating extra error messages
  after the first error message or warning.  Haven't had time to track
  this down yet.  Problem seems to only affect the 32-bit Windows
  version (anybody still use that?).
<li> The functions EnterIntervalFinding and EnterGaussianFinding seem
  to give probabity 1 to a single state no matter the width of the
  interval or the SD.
<li> The functions CalcNodeValue and CalcNodeState return NA when I
  think they should return a non-missing value.
<li> The function NodeExpectedUtils is generating an internal Netica
  error.
<li> If a node has a name which is too close to the 30 character
  limit, and that node is disconnected from a link, leaving a stub
  variable, then the stub variable will have a name that is longer
  than 30 characters, causing problems.  To avoid make sure names are
  no more than 26 characters.  UPDATE.  Changed as.IDname() to make
  shorter names.
</ol>
<p> Approximately 4/5 of the API functionality is mapped.  Things that
  are still not mapped:
<ol>
<li> Testers
<li> DBN functionality
<li> Database suppot (I see no need to do this as better to use the
  DBI R package).
</ol>

<a name="License"><h2>RNetica License Information</h2></a>
<p>
There are three layers to the complete RNetica environment, each with
their own licensing terms.

<ol>

  <li> The <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Programming
  Language</a> is released under
  the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU
  General Public License (GPL)</a> version 2.  See
  the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Can-I-use-R-for-commercial-purposes_003f">R
  FAQ</a> for more information.

  <li>The Netica API is a commercial product.  License terms can be
  found on the <a href="http://www.norsys.com">Norsys&reg;</a> web site.

  <li>RNetica itself (the combination of R and C code that provides
  the glue between R and Netica) is made available under
  the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/Artistic-2.0">Artistic
  License, version 2.0</a>.

</ol>

I am not a lawyer, and therefore this should not be considered formal
legal advise, but my understanding is that for most uses the use of
RNetica requires the purchase of a Netica API license (which is
different from the Netica GUI license) from Norsys.
<p>
Once you have obtained a license key from Norsys, you can use it in
one of two ways.  First, it can be passed as an argument to the
function <code>StartNetica(<i>license key</i>)</code> (you may need to
call <code>StopNetica()</code> first).  Second, if you execute the
command <code>NeticaLicenseKey &lt;- <i>license key</i></code> in the
main R workspace (the default namespace), then RNetica will use that
value when loaded through <code>library(RNetica)</code>.  
<p>
Without the license key, the Netica API operates in a limited mode.
All of the functions in the test scripts will run, but the size of the
networks is generally limited.

<h2>Current Version Status</h2>
<p>
The current version (0.4-1) incorporates approximately 75% of the
Netica C API Version 5.04 (no new version since 2012).  This is
sufficient functionality to build, compile and carry out inferences
with a Bayesian network.  Some of the more advanced functionality,
including support for databases, influence diagrams, and dynamic
Bayesian networks is not yet developed.
<p>
Although an extensive test script exists for RNetica (most of this is
exposed on the manual pages), the testing away from these simple tests
has been particularly light.  In particular, I have not yet used
valgrind to test for memory leaks.  It is currently a beta release.
Note that because it uses calls to C code, <i>it is possible for RNetica
to crash R.</i>  Plan your work accordingly.
<p>
The development has been with R version 3.0.1 under Ubuntu
14.04 with Netica API 5.04.  <code>R CMD check RNetica</code> 
runs under Mac OS X and Windows 7 without errors.  Almost all of the
testing has been with the 64 bit versions of R and Netica.  There may
be some problems that crop up under 32 bit versions.  
<p>
Version 0.2-7 was developed and tested under R 2.15.2.  The windows
binary for that version is a R 2.15 binary.

<p>
Note the source versions have been compiled and tested under
Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Windows.  Note that for Windows and Mac OS X,
compiling source packages requires the R development kit to be
installed.  See the
appropriate <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/faqs.html">R
FAQ</a> for your operating system.  You should also be familiar with
building R packages, see
the <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">Writing R Extensions</a> manual.

<p>
Compiling from sources requires that you have already downloaded and
unpacked the Netica C API
from <a href="http://www.norsys.com/">Norsys<a/>.  Under *nix
(including Mac OS X) the location of the library can be passed to the
configure command, e.g.:
<p>
<code>R CMD INSTALL RNetica --configure-args='--with-netica=/Users/ralmond/software/Netica_API_504/'</code>
<p>
Under Windows (or as an alternative to the <code>--with-netica</code> 
switch), the environmental variable <code>NETICA_HOME</code> can be
set to the location in which the Netica API was unpacked.  I have only
tested with the API version 5.04, not with earlier versions.  
<p>
Although I am now supplying Windows and Mac OS X binaries, which
include the Netica API (currently version 5.04).  As this is still an
early test release, it will help you to have a local R guru to ask
support questions, and help file bug reports if needed.  NOTE:  this
is an unlicensed version of the API:  you still need to purchase a
license (although the unlicensed version will run the sample code in
the man pages).

<h2>Development Version</h2>
<p>
The latest development version is available as a subversion repository
at:  <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RNetica/">https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RNetica/</a>.  
<p>
If you have patches or other correspondence about RNetica you can
contact me at <a href="mailto:almond@acm.org">almond@acm.org<a/>.  
If you are filing a bug report, please be sure to include the
following information:
<ol>
<li> The version number of CPTtools and R that you are using.
<li> Your operating system and whether it is 64 or 32 bit.
<li> The exact text of any error message that is generated.
<li> A small script that reproduces the problem (if at all possible).
</ol>
