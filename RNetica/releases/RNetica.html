<h1>About RNetica</h1>
<p>
RNetica is best thought of as a "glue" layer between the open source
statistical programming language
R <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>
and the proprietary Bayesian network engine
Netica &reg; <a href="http://www.norsys.com">http://www.norsys.com/</a>.
Although there are some minor extensions to the Netica API, the
primary purpose of RNetica is to provide a binding for the Netica API
functions inside of R.  
<p>
There are two big advantages to this.  One is that while the Netica
GUI is helpful for model development, entering evidence by point and
click is cumbersome for real work.  Embedding the Netica API within R
means that R can be used for data preparation and cleaning, the data
can be entered into a model developed with the Netica GUI and the
results extracted and graphed using the graphical power of R.  The
second big advantage is that R is an interpreted language, which
supports rapid improvisation of code.  This make it substantially
faster to work in RNetica than using the C or Java APIs.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
I recently did a demonstration of RNetica for my Bayes net class and
recorded it using Tegrity.  I'm posting a few of those resources here
as a way of getting started.
<ul>
<li> The <a href="https://tegr.it/y/1ijsr">Tegrity recording</a> and
  the slightly edited <a href="RNetica.txt">R transcript</a>.
<li>The Slides used for the talk.  Note that these were revised an
  expanded after the class and now contain lots of additional
  material, including an index of RNetica functions grouped by topic.
  (<a href="RNetica.pptx">PowerPoint</a>, <a href="RNetica.pdf">PDF</a>).
<li> A sample RNetica script for restoring a network after restarting
  R.  (<a href="irt5.R">irt5.R</a>)  Note:  this uses one of the
  RNetica sample scripts (in the sampleNets folder after you install
  RNetica).  
<li> A sample RNetica script for building a Network and doing some
  inference.  (<a href="irt3.R">irt3.R</a>)  The network built by the
  script is here (<a href="irt5.R">irt5.R</a>).
</ul>

<h2> User Registration Survey</h2>
There is now an RNetica user survey.  I want to count my users so I
can tell the funding agencies they should give me more money to work
on
it.  <a href="https://fsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7QVrVvd4NlwOYrb">Click
  here</a> to fill out the survey.

<h2>News</h2>
<i>The 0.7 release changes the way that the <code>[]</code>
  and <code>[[]]</code> opertators are used in a way that breaks
  backwards compatability.  The <code>[]</code> operator 
  is used to manipulate CPTs for probabilistic nodes and
  the <code>[[]]</code> operator is used to manipulate value tables
  for deterministic (logical) nodes.</i>
<ol>
  <li> Changed the way the <code>[[]]</code> and <code>[]</code>
    operators work.  Now <code>[</code> and <code>[&lt;-</code> always
    manipulate CPTs for probabilistic nodes.  This should fix a
    problem with being unable to use the <code>[]</code> to set CPTs
    for continuous nodes that have been discritized.  </li>
  <li> The <code>[[</code> and <code>[[&lt;-</code> operators now focus
    on manipulating the the value tables for deterministic nodes.</li>
  <li> The <code>[[...]]</code> expression is no longer a synnonmym
    for <code>[[...,drop=TRUE]]</code>.  This may break some code but
    it should be straightforward to fix.</li>
  <li> Added a new <code>testNetwork</code> function which can be used
    to calculate evidentiary power of the networks.</li>
</ol>

<i>The 0.5 release is a major rewrite of the fundamental Network and
  Node objects.  This should improve stability, but may cause
  problems.</i>  The changes in the 0.5 series include the following:
<ol>
  <li> Moved a couple of functions from RNetica to CPTtools, as I
    needed them there.  RNetica now depends on CPTtools.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem in NodeExpectedUtils.</li>
  <li>Brent identified a couple issues (including one in
    AdjoinNetworks) as being related to problems merging networks with
    and without visual information.  Fix soon.  I have been manually
    deleting visual information (V1, V2, ...) in .dne files as a work around.</li>
  <li>Brent is promising me a new version of Netica API (latest is
  still 5.04, released in 2012), soon.  Hopefully, this will fix a few
  things.</li> 
  <li> Introduced a new <code>NeticaSession</code> object as a
  container for the link to the Netica session.  This also serves as a
  container for all of the networks included in a session and a
    wrapper for the license key.
  <li> <i>The license key mechanism is now handled differently.</i>
  Now the Netica License Key string is passed to the NeticaSession
  object when it is constructed.  If no session is specified for a
  function that requires one, then the
  variable <code>DefaultNeticaSession</code> in the global
  environment is referenced.
  <li> Several functions now require a <code>NeticaSession</code> as
  an argument.  These include the high level
  functions  <code>CreateNetwork</code>, <code>GetNthNetwork</code>,  
  <code>GetNamedNetworks</code>, and <code>ReadNetworks</code>.  A
  session argument is also needed by some lower level functions which
  create Netica objects: 
  <code>CaseFileDelimiter</code>, <code>CaseFileMissingCode</code>,
  <code>CaseFileStream</code>, <code>CaseMemoryStream</code>,
  <code>OpenCaseStream</code> and <code>NewNeticaRNG</code>.
  In all cases, if no session argument is supplied the value
  of <code>DefaultNeticaSession</code> is used instead.
  <li> Objects of type <code>NeticaSession</code>,
    <code>NeticaBN</code>, <code>NeticaNode</code>,  <code>CaseStream</code>,
    and <code>NeticaRNG</code> are now R reference classes (a special
    case of S4 classes) instead of strings with with attributes
    including an S3 class string.  This should prove more robust as
    certain R functions (in particular, <code>c()</code>) which
    stripped the attributes.  
    <ol>
      <li> The function <code>as.character</code> for networks and
      nodes now returns a string of the
      form <code>&lt;<i>Type</i>: <i>Name</i>&gt;</code> instead of
      the name of the object.  Use the
      expression <code><i>obj</i>$Name</code> to get the name of the
      object. 
      <li> The primitive R function <code>as.character</code> has
      unexpected results when applied to a list of nodes (or
      presumably nets).  In stead of recursively applying the
      proper <code>as.character</code> method for the class, it
      applies a default method which returns <code>&lt;S4 object of
      type \"NeticaNode"&gt;</code>.
      Use <code>sapply(<i>nodelist</i>,NodeName)</code> instead.
      <li> One unintended consequence of this is that the
      expression <code>match(<i>node</i>, <i>nodelist</i>)</code> no
      longer works as expected.  This appears to be a bug in R
      as <code>match</code> turns objects into strings before
      matching, but the bug in <code>as.character</code> when applied
      to a list produces unexpected results.
      Use <code>match(<i>node</i>,
      sapply(<i>nodelist</i>,NodeName))</code> instead.
    </ol>
  <li> The way that Netica to R back pointers work has been changed in
  this release.  In version 0.4 and before back pointers to the R
  objects were stored inside of the Netica Net and Node objects (using
  a special field designed for that purpose).  However, there were
  some occasions on which functions which needed to find an R object
  for a Netica object (e.g., <code>NodeParent</code>) would sometimes
  return a non-R object (e.g., <code>FALSE</code>).  In the new system
  network objects are cached in the <code>NeticaSession</code> object
  and node objects are cached in the <code>NeticaBN</code> object.
    <ol>
      <li> The network cache is an environment
      called <code>$nets</code> in the <code>NeticaSession</code>
      object.  This can be used in a read-only way by RNetica users.
      In particular, <code><i>session</i>$nets$<i>netname</i></code>,
      where <i>netname</i> is the Netica name of the network, can be
      used to reference a network in a session.
      <li> The node cache is an environment called <code>$nodes</code>
      in the <code>NeticaBN</code> object.    Again, this can be used
      in a read-only way,
        e.g., <code><i>net</i>$nodes$<i>nodename</i></code>.
      <li> R objects for networks are created and registered with the
      cache in the session when the network is created
      (<code>CreateNetwork</code>) or read into RNetica
      (<code>ReadNetworks</code>).  R objects are only created and
      registered with the cache in the network when first accessed.
      Calling the function <code>NetworkAllNodes</code> on the network
      will create R objects for all nodes in the network and register
      them. 
    </ol>
  <li> The <code>CaseStream</code> object is now an abstract class,
    with two concrete subclasses:  <code>FileCaseStream</code>
    and <code>MemoryCaseStream</code>.  Again, these are now
    represented as reference class objects and not strings with
    attributes, so they should be more robust.  
    <ol>
      <li> The constructors, <code>CaseFileStream()</code> 
        and <code>CaseMemoryStream()</code> (note that the name of the
        constructor is not the name of the class) require a session
        attribute.
      <li>The class <code>MemoryCaseStream</code> has been renamed
        name from "CaseSMemorytreamm".  The constructor is
        still <code>CaseMemoryStream()</code> (this now matches the
        pattern used for <code>FileCaseStream</code>).
      <li> There are still problems
      using <code>MemoryCaseStream</code> objects with some RNetica
      functions (notably <code>LearnCPTs</code>).  For the moment,
        it is safer to stick with the files which seem to work better.
      <li> It should be the case that <code>CaseStream</code> objects
      are closed when the session is stopped, but it is safer to
      use <code>WithOpenCaseStream</code> to ensure closure.
    </ol>
  <li> <i>Sessions are no longer started automatically when RNetica is
  loaded, they now must be started manually.</i>  The new
  commands <code>startSession()</code>, <code>stopSession()</code>
  and <code>restartSession()</code> (which take a session object as an
    argument) handle this.
    <ol>
      <li> Typical calling sequence is <code>session &lt;-
          NeticaSession(LicenseKey="<i>keystring</i>")</code> followed by
        <code>startSession(session)</code>.  If <code>session</code>
        is an object stored in the R global workspace, the first step
        only needs to be executed the first time RNetica is used, the
        second will be available thereafter.
      <li> The function <code>StartNetica</code> creates a new Netica
        session and starts it.  The function <code>StopNetica</code>
        stops the default session (unless given an argument).
      <li> The old behavior can be restored by setting the value of
      the global variable <code>DefaultNeticaSession</code> to the
      session object.  The function <code>getDefaultSession()</code>
      provides the default for most functions where a session argument
      is required.  This uses the value
      of <code>DefaultNeticaSession</code>, starting it if it is
      currently closed.  If the value is unset, the user will be
      prompted (in an interactive session) to create a value for this
      variable (using the value of <code>NeticaLicenseKey</code> if it
        exists) to create one.
      <li> The Netica license key is stored as a unencrypted string in
      the <code>NeticaSession</code> object.  Do not share licensed
      session objects with people who are not authorized to use that
        license key.
        <li> It is unknown what will happen if two sessions are
        started at the same time, but unexpected consequences are
        quite likely.
    </ol>
  <li> Error handling is now handled by the <code>NeticaSession</code>
    object.  <code>NeticaBN</code> objects (as well as case stream and
    rng objects) have back pointers to the
    session object (the
    field <code>$Session</code>).  <code>NeticaNode</code> objects
    have back pointers to the network objects
    (field <code>$Net</code>).  This should be mostly transparent to users.
  <li> A long standing bug in which a Netica error or warning would be
    followed by a series of warnings about bad error code has been found
    and fixed, as has a problem with the internal R protection stack
    that was trigger by this bug.  This should result in greater stability.
  <li> The functions in <a href="Peanut.html">Peanut and PNetica</a>
    version 0.2 are almost certainly not compatible with this
    release.  An updated version of these packages should be available
    shortly.  <a href="CPTtools.html">CPTtools</a> should not be affected.
</ol>
<p>
The 0.4 series of releases includes the following
improvements:
<ol>
<li> Added the functions MutualInfo, NodeExpectedValue and
  VarianceOfReal (user request, plus close to the top of my personal
  list). 
<li> Minimal support for equation.  (I find
  the <a href="CPTtools.html">CPTtools</a> easier to use for
  manipulating conditional probability tables.)
<li> Added more functions for decision nets, although these are not
  currently working (support request in to Norsys).
<li> A few other functions related to calculating values and interval
  and Gaussian findings.  Again, these are not working in the 0.4-1
  version and a help request to Norsys is pending.
<li> Added some random findings generation code.  
<li> Cleaned up the behavior of as.IDname() so that it makes shorter
  names and is properly vectorized.
<li> Fixed some minor errors and problems with error handling.
<li> Added a new cc() function (and methods for c()) to keep c() from
  dropping attributes.  (<i>Update</i> these were dropped in RNetica 0.5.)
</ol>
<p>
The 0.3 series of releases includes a number of different improvements.
<ol>
<li> I now how official permission to distribute binary versions from
  Norsys.  (You may want to still download and compile from sources
  you need the latest version of the API.)
<li> RNetica now passes the self-test
  under <code>gctorture(TRUE)</code>, which should mean that is it is
  much more robust to memory errors.  This is still a beta version,
  caution is still advisable.
<li>It now has case file support and includes support for learning
  conditional probability tables 
<li> I've moved my development and testing platform to R 3.0.1.
  Binaries are build for R version 3.x.
<li> The version 0.3 cycle is more or less complete,
  except that I'm waiting for API updates from Norsys in response to
  problems. 
</ol>
<p> Known issues with this release.</p>
<ol>
<li> There is currently no way through the Netica API to check whether
  EM and Gradient decent learning converged or timed out due to the
  maximum number of iterations being reached.
<li> Currently, memory streams cannot be used with the LearnCPTs
  functions.  This appears to be a Netica problem.
<li> The functions EnterIntervalFinding and EnterGaussianFinding seem
  to give probability 1 to a single state no matter the width of the
  interval or the SD.
<li> The functions CalcNodeValue and CalcNodeState return NA when I
  think they should return a non-missing value.
<li> The function NodeExpectedUtils is generating an internal Netica
  error.
<li> The functions CreateNetwork and ReadNetworks assume that
  startSession() has been called. They now should give sensible error
  messages when this occurs.
<li> If a node has a name which is too close to the 30 character
  limit, and that node is disconnected from a link, leaving a stub
  variable, then the stub variable will have a name that is longer
  than 30 characters, causing problems.  To avoid make sure names are
  no more than 26 characters.  UPDATE.  Changed as.IDname() to make
  shorter names.
<li> Brent has promised me a beta version of the API fixing some of
  these issues soon.
</ol>
<p> Approximately 4/5 of the API functionality is mapped.  Things that
  are still not mapped:
<ol>
<li> DBN functionality
<li> Database support (I see no need to do this as better to use the
  DBI R package).
</ol>

<a name="License"><h2>RNetica License Information</h2></a>
<p>
There are three layers to the complete RNetica environment, each with
their own licensing terms.

<ol>

  <li> The <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Programming
  Language</a> is released under
  the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU
  General Public License (GPL)</a> version 2.  See
  the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Can-I-use-R-for-commercial-purposes_003f">R
  FAQ</a> for more information.

  <li>The Netica API is a commercial product.  License terms can be
  found on the <a href="http://www.norsys.com">Norsys&reg;</a> web site.

  <li>RNetica itself (the combination of R and C code that provides
  the glue between R and Netica) is made available under
  the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/Artistic-2.0">Artistic
  License, version 2.0</a>.

</ol>

I am not a lawyer, and therefore this should not be considered formal
legal advise, but my understanding is that for most uses the use of
RNetica requires the purchase of a Netica API license (which is
different from the Netica GUI license) from Norsys.
<p>
<b><i>Updated!</i></b> Once you have obtained a license key from
Norsys, the license is used by executing the following lines of code:
<pre>
<i>session</i> &lt;- NeticaSession(LicenseKey="<i>Code from Norsys</i>")
startSession(<i>session</i>)
</pre>
where <i>session</i> can be replaced with any legal R identifier.
Note that if <code>DefaultNeticaSession</code> is used as the
identifier, most functions that need session arguments will accept this
value instead.  See the help for <code>StartNetica()</code> for
alternative ways of using the License key.  (Backwards compatibility
is currently there.)

Note that the Netica license key is stored in plain text in
the <code>NeticaSession</code> object.  Do not share that object
(e.g., through sharing R dump files) with somebody who is not
authorized to use that license.
<p>
Without the license key, the Netica API operates in a limited mode.
All of the functions in the test scripts will run, but the size of the
networks is generally limited.

<h2>Current Version Status</h2>
<p>
The current version (0.5-4) incorporates approximately 75% of the
Netica C API Version 5.04 (5.10 for Windows).  This is
sufficient functionality to build, compile and carry out inferences
with a Bayesian network.  Some of the more advanced functionality,
including support for databases, influence diagrams, and dynamic
Bayesian networks is not yet developed.
<p>
Although an extensive test script exists for RNetica (most of this is
exposed on the manual pages), the testing away from these simple tests
has been particularly light.  In particular, I have not yet used
valgrind to test for memory leaks.  It is currently a beta release.
Note that because it uses calls to C code, <i>it is possible for RNetica
to crash R.</i>  Plan your work accordingly.
<p>
The development has been with R version 3.0.1&ndash;3.5.3 under Ubuntu
16.04--18.04 with Netica API 5.04.  <code>R CMD check RNetica</code> 
runs under Mac OS X and Windows 7 without errors.  Almost all of the
testing has been with the 64 bit versions of R and Netica.  There may
be some problems that crop up under 32 bit versions.  
<p>
Version 0.2-7 was developed and tested under R 2.15.2.  The windows
binary for that version is a R 2.15 binary.

<p>
Note the source versions have been compiled and tested under
Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Windows.  Note that for Windows and Mac OS X,
compiling source packages requires the R development kit to be
installed.  See the
appropriate <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/faqs.html">R
FAQ</a> for your operating system.  You should also be familiar with
building R packages, see
the <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">Writing R Extensions</a> manual.

<p>
Compiling from sources requires that you have already downloaded and
unpacked the Netica C API
from <a href="http://www.norsys.com/">Norsys<a/>.  Under *nix
(including Mac OS X) the location of the library can be passed to the
configure command, e.g.:
<p>
<code>R CMD INSTALL RNetica --configure-args='--with-netica=/Users/ralmond/software/Netica_API_504/'</code>
<p>
Under Windows (or as an alternative to the <code>--with-netica</code> 
switch), the environmental variable <code>NETICA_HOME</code> can be
set to the location in which the Netica API was unpacked.  I have only
tested with the API version 5.04, not with earlier (or later) versions.  
<p>
Although I am now supplying Windows and Mac OS X binaries, which
include the Netica API (currently version 5.04).  As this is still an
early test release, it will help you to have a local R guru to ask
support questions, and help file bug reports if needed.  NOTE:  this
is an unlicensed version of the API:  you still need to purchase a
license (although the unlicensed version will run the sample code in
the man pages).
<p> A recent communication with Brent
  indicated that a new Netica API will be out soon.  When that comes
  out, there will likely be a big update. 

<h2>Development Version</h2>
<p>
The latest development version is available as a subversion repository
at:  <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RNetica/">https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RNetica/</a>.
There is also a branch corresponding to the old object model at:
<a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RNetica/branches/RNeticaS3">https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RNetica/branches/RNeticaS3</a>.
<p>
  
If you have patches or other correspondence about RNetica you can
contact me at <a href="mailto:almond@acm.org">almond@acm.org<a/>.  
If you are filing a bug report, please be sure to include the
following information:
<ol>
<li> The version number of RNetica and R that you are using.
<li> Your operating system and whether it is 64 or 32 bit.
<li> The exact text of any error message that is generated.
<li> A small script that reproduces the problem (if at all possible).
</ol>
