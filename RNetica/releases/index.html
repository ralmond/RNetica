<h1>About RNetica</h1>

RNetica is best thought of as a "glue" layer between the open source
statistical programming language
R <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>
and the proprietary Bayesian network engine
Netica &reg; <a href="http://www.norsys.com">http://www.norsys.com/</a>.
Although there are some minor extensions to the Netica API, the
primary purpose of RNetica is to provide a binding for the Netica API
functions inside of R.  

There are two big advantages to this.  One is that while the Netica
GUI is helpful for model development, entering evidence by point and
click is cumbersome for real work.  Embedding the Netica API within R
means that R can be used for data preparation and cleaning, the data
can be entered into a model developed with the Netica GUI and the
results extracted and graphed using the graphical power of R.  The
second big advantage is that R is an interpreted language, which
supports rapid improvisation of code.  This make it substantially
faster to work in RNetica than using the C or Java APIs.

<h2>RNetica License Information</h2>

There are three layers to the complete RNetica environment, each with
their own licensing terms.

<ol>

  <li> The <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Programming
  Language</a> is released under
  the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU
  General Public License (GPL)</a> version 2.  See
  the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Can-I-use-R-for-commercial-purposes_003f">R
  FAQ</a> for more information.

  <li>The Netica API is a commercial product.  License terms can be
  found on the <a href="http://www.norsys.com">Norsys&reg;</a> web site.

  <li>RNetica itself (the combination of R and C code that provides
  the glue between R and Netica) is made available under
  the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/Artistic-2.0">Artistic
  License, version 2.0</a>.

</ol>

I am not a lawyer, and therefore this should not be considered formal
legal advise, but my understanding is that for most uses the use of
RNetica requires the purchase of a Netica API license (which is
different from the Netica GUI license) from Norsys.

Once you have obtained a license key from Norsys, you can use it in
one of two ways.  First, it can be passed as an argument to the
function <code>StartNetica(<i>license key</i>)</code> (you may need to
call <code>StopNetica()</code> first).  Second, if you execute the
command <code>NeticaLicenseKey &lt;- <i>license key</i></code> in the
main R workspace (the default namespace), then RNetica will use that
value when loaded through <code>library(RNetica)</code>.  

Without the license key, the Netica API operates in a limited mode.
All of the functions in the test scripts will run, but the size of the
networks is generally limited.

<h2>Current Version Status</h2>

The current version (0.2-7) incorporates approximately 3/5 of the
Netica C API Version 5.04.  This is sufficient functionality to build,
compile and carry out inferences with a Bayesian network.  Some of the
more advanced functionality, including support for case files,
influence diagrams, and dynamic Bayesian networks is not yet
developed. 
<p>
Although an extensive test script exists for RNetica (most of this is
exposed on the manual pages), the testing away from these simple tests
has been particularly light.  In particular, no real stress testing
has taken place.  It is probably best considered somewhere between an
alpha and a beta release.  Note that because it uses calls to C code,
it is possible for RNetica to crash R.  Plan your work accordingly.
<p>
Most of the development has been with R version 2.15.2 under Ubuntu
12.04 with Netica API 5.04.  <code>R CMD check RNetica</code> 
runs under Mac OS X and Windows 7 without errors.  Almost all of the
testing has been with the 64 bit versions of R and Netica.  There may
be some problems that crop up under 32 bit versions.

Note the source versions have been compiled and tested under
Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Windows.  Note that for Windows and Mac OS X,
compiling source packages requires the R development kit to be
installed.  See the
appropriate <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/faqs.html">R
  FAQ</a>.  You should also be familiar with building R packages, see
the <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">Writing   
  R Extensions</a> manual.

<p>
Compiling from sources requires that you have already downloaded and
unpacked the Netica C API
from <a href="http://www.norsys.com/">Norsys<a/>.  Under *nix
(including Mac OS X) the location of the library can be passed to the
configure command, e.g.:
<p>
<code>R CMD INSTALL RNetica --configure-args='--with-netica=/Users/ralmond/software/Netica_API_504/'</code>
<p>
Under Windows (or as an alternative to the <code>--with-netica</code> 
switch), the environmental variable <code>NETICA_HOME</code> can be
set to the location in which the Netica API was unpacked.  I have only
tested with the API version 5.04, not with earlier versions.  
<p>
Windows and Mac OS X binaries are not yet available, as they would
involve distributing the Netica shared library, and hence requires
additional permission from Norsys.  Also, as this is still an early
test release, I want to make sure that users have a local R guru to
ask support questions, and help file bug reports if needed.

<h2><a name="FAQ">FAQ</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>How do I compile RNetica?</dt>
  <dd>Start by skimming the <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">Writing   
  R Extensions</a> manual so that you understand how R binary packages
  are built.  Then you will issue a command like <code>R CMD INSTALL
  RNetica
  --configure-args='--with-netica=/Users/ralmond/software/Netica_API_504/'</code>,
  where you have adjusted the latter bit to the directory where you
  have downloaded the Netica API.</dd>
  <dt>How do I compile RNetica under Windows?</dt>
  <dd>Compiling R under Windows requires installing enough of the
  standard GNU tools to build R, as well as the right compilers.
  Follow the recipe in the <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/faqs.html">R
  FAQ</a> for Windows, and you should be fine.</dd>
  <dt> How do I compile RNetica under Mac OS X or GNU/Linux?</dt>
  <dd> Mac OS X users need to install the software developer kit which
  is a free download (with registration) from Apple.  Linux users win,
  as most Linux distributions come with all of the GNU tools you need
  pre-installed.</dd>
  <dt>When will binaries be available?</dt>
  <dd>Currently, RNetica is fairly lightly tested.  In particular,
  there is a possibility for some strange interactions between the R
  garbage collection system and the handles coming back from RNetica
  that could produce serious problems (e.g., memory leaks, crashing
  R).  I need to do some serious stress testing before releasing a
  binary package for people who are not used to computer debugging.
  There is also a licensing problem as I do not have permission from
  Netica to redistribute the API.  (This is probably solvable, but no
  point until I solve the first problem.)
  <dt>How do I get support for RNetica?</dt>
  <dd>You can't.  The good folks at Norsys don't know enough about R
  to help you, and I'm mostly too busy.  I will, however, cheerfully
  accept bug reports and try to respond to those as quickly as I
  can.</dd>
  <dt>Okay, so how to I file a bug report?</dt>
  <dd>Send me email with the following information:
    <ol>
      <li> Details about your environment (operating system, 32 or 64 bit,
        R version, Netica version, RNetica version).</li>
      <li> Exactly what you were doing when you generated the error.  It
        really helps me if you can make a small example that reproduces the
        problem.  If I can't reproduce the problem, I can't fix the bug.
      <li> What you expected to happen and what actually happened.
      <li> The exact text of the error message you got (this may be
      many lines, more is generally better here).
    </ol>
    Bug reports that are missing this information will be referenced
    back to the FAQ.
