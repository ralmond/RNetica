<h1>About RNetica</h1>

RNetica is best thought of as a "glue" layer between the open source
stasticial programing language
R <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>
and the proprietary Bayesian network engine
Netica <a href="http://www.norsys.com">http://www.norsys.com/</a>.
Although there are some minor extensions to the Netica API, the
primary purpose of RNetica is to provide a binding for the Netica API
functions inside of R.  

There are two big advantages to this.  One is that while the Netica
GUI is helpful for model development, entering evidence by point and
click is cumbersome for real work.  Embedding the Netica API within R
means that R can be used for data preparation and cleaning, the data
can be entered into a model developed with the Netica GUI and the
results extracted and graphed using the graphical power of R.  The
second big advantage is that R is an interpreted language, which
supports rapid improvisation of code.  This make it substantially
faster to work in RNetica than using the C or Java APIs.

<h2>RNetica License Information</h2>

There are three layers to the complete RNetica environment, each with
their own licensing terms.

<ol>

  <li> The <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Programming
  Language</a> is released under
  the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU
  General Public License (GPL)</a> version 2.  See
  the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Can-I-use-R-for-commercial-purposes_003f">R
  FAQ</a> for more information.

  <li>The Netica API is a commerical product.  License terms can be
  found on the <a href="http://www.norsys.com">Norsys</a> web site.

  <li>RNetica itself (the combination of R and C code that provides
  the glue between R and Netica) is made available under
  the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/Artistic-2.0">Artistic
  License, version 2.0</a>.

I am not a lawyer, and therefore this should not be considered formal
legal advise, but my understanding is that for most uses, the use of
RNetica requires the purchase of a Netica API license (which is different from
the Netica GUI license) from Norsys.

Once you have obtained a license key from Norsys, you can use it in
one of two ways.  First, it can be passed as an argument to the
function <code>StartNetica(<i>license key</i>)</code> (you may need to
call <code>StopNetica()</code> first).  Second, if you exectue the
command <code>NeticaLicenseKey &lt;- <i>license key</i></code> in the
main R workspace (the default namespace), then RNetica will use that
value when loaded through <code>library(RNetica)</code>.  

Without the license key, the Netica API operates in a limited mode.
All of the functions in the test scripts will run, but the size of the
networks is generally limited.

<h2>Current Version Status</h2>

The current version (0.2-6) incorporates approximately 3/5 of the
Netica C API Version 5.04.  This is sufficient functionality to build,
compile and carry out inferences with a Bayesian network.  Some of the
more advances functionality, including support for case files,
influence diagrams, and dynamic Bayesian networks is not yet
developed. 
<p>
Although an extensive test script exists for RNetica (most of this is
exposed on the manual pages), the testing away from these simple tests
has been particularly light.  In particular, no real stress testing
has taken place.  It is probably best considered somewhere between an
alpha and a beta release.  Note that because it uses calls to C code,
it is possible for RNetica to crash R.  Plan your work accordingly.
<p>
Most of the development has been with R version 2.15.2 under Ubunto
12.04 with Netica API 5.04.  <code>R CMD check RNetica</code> 
runs under Mac OS X and Windows 7 without errors.  Almost all of the
testing has been with the 64 bit versions of R and Netica.  There may
be some problems that crop up under 32 bit versions.  

<h1>RNetica Releases</h1>

The following releases are archived here:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Release</th><th>Source</th><th>ManualX</th><th>Notes</th>
<tr>
<td>0.1-8</td><td><a href="RNetica_0.1-8.tar.gz">RNetica_0.1-8.tar.gz</a></td>
<td></td><td>First reasonably functional version.</td>
<td>0.2-5</td><td><a href="RNetica_0.2-5.tar.gz">RNetica_0.2-5.tar.gz</a></td>
<td></td><td>Initial version used for Newton's Playground</td>
<td>0.2-6</td><td><a href="RNetica_0.2-6.tar.gz">RNetica_0.2-6.tar.gz</a></td>
<td><a href="RNetica-manual_0.2-6.pdf">RNetica-manual_0.2-6.pdf</a></td><td>Fixed Windows installation.</td>
</table>

Note that the source version is the preferred version for installation
under Linux/Unix.  Compiled versions are available for some Mac OS X
and Windows releases.  The source version can be used for Mac OS X and
Windows as well, however, the R development kit needs to be
installed.  See the
appropriate <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/faqs.html">R
  FAQ</a>.   
<p>
Compiling from sources requires that you have already downloaded and
unpacked the Netica C API
from <a href="http://www.norsys.com/">Norsys<a/>.  Under *nix
(including Mac OS X) the location of hte library can be passed to the
configure command, e.g.:
<p>
<code>R CMD INSTALL RNetica --configure-args='--with-netica=/Users/ralmond/software/Netica_API_504/'</code>
<p>
Under Windows (or as an alternative to the <code>--with-netica</code> 
switch), the environmental variable <code>NETICA_HOME</code> can be
set to the location in which the Netica API was unpacked.  I have only
tested with the API version 5.04, not with earlier versions.  
<p>
Windows and Mac OS X binarys are not yet available, as they would
involve distributing the Netica shared library, and hence requires
additional permission from Norsys.

<h2>Development Version</h2>

The latest development version is available as a subversion repository
at:  <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RNetica/">https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/RNetica/</a>.
