<p>
This website plays host to two different packages of functions useful
for building Bayesian networks:  RNetica and CPTtools.
<p>
Both packages are in early alpha release, there may be bugs and
problmes and users should be comfortable debugging in R.  Although I
am happy to accept bug reports, I do not promise to respond to them in
a timely fashion.


<h1>About RNetica</h1>
<p>
RNetica is best thought of as a "glue" layer between the open source
statistical programming language
R <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>
and the proprietary Bayesian network engine
Netica &reg; <a href="http://www.norsys.com">http://www.norsys.com/</a>.
Doing non-trivial work with RNetica requries the purchase of a Netica
API license from Norsys.  
<p>
RNetica is now distributed in both source and object forms.
Note that because RNetica uses c code, it requires knowledge of how to
compile R packages.  Instructions can be found
at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.

<h1>CPTtools</h1>
<p>
Conditional Probability Table (CPT) Tools is a package of R functions
for constructing and manipulating conditional probability tables: one
fo the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks.  The
tools were originally designed to work with StatShop (an internal
Bayesian network program developed at ETS), but they are general
enough to work with other Bayes net packages as well.  The versions
here are compatable with RNetica.  
<p>
It also contains tools for displaying and analyzing the output of
Bayesian network analyses.  Again, the tools were originally designed
to work with the output of StatShop, but work equally well with
RNetica output.  Again, they should work with the output of other
Bayes net packages with minimal adaptation.
<p>
CPTtools is also an alpha release, with minimal testing.  However, the
code is all in R, and hence does not require advanced knowledge of R.
