  <h1>RNetica, PNetica, CPTtools, Peanut and RGAuilts</h1>
  <p>
This website plays host to four (for sufficiently large values of 4)
different packages of functions useful 
for building Bayesian networks:  <a href="RNetica.html">RNetica</a>,
<a href="CPTtools.html">CPTtools</a>, <a href="Peanut.html">PNetica and
  Peanut</a>.
  </p>
<p>
RNetica and CPTtools are beta-quality releases and Peanut and PNetica
are both in early alpha stages.  There may be bugs and 
problems and users should be comfortable debugging in R.  Although I
am happy to accept bug reports, I do not promise to respond to them in
a timely fashion.
</p>

<p>
Note that CPTtools is meant to be independent of the Bayes net
implementation and Peanut, the object oriented later on top of it,
depends on CPTtools but not the implementation specific packages.
RNetica depends on the Netica Bayes net engine and PNetica is the
Peanut implementation using RNetica.
</p>
<p>
I presented information about Peanut and PNetica, as well as
CPTtools and RNetica, at the UAI workshop in 2015.  The official
paper is published
in <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1565/bmaw2015_paper4.pdf">CEUR
    volume 1565, paper 4</a>.  Slides for the talk are available here
(<a href="DIRT-talk.pdf">PDF</a>).

<h1>User Survey</h1>

<p>
I'm now conducting a user survey.  It looks like I have more users
than I thought I did, and I want to know a little bit about the
projects for which RNetica is being used.  (This will help me get
funding to continue working on it.)
</p>
<p>
Please fill out the RNetica (and other package) 
<a href="https://fsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7QVrVvd4NlwOYrb">survey</a>.
</p>
<h1>About RNetica</h1>
<p>
RNetica is best thought of as a "glue" layer between the open source
statistical programming language
R <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>
and the proprietary Bayesian network engine
Netica &reg; <a href="http://www.norsys.com">http://www.norsys.com/</a>.
Doing non-trivial work with RNetica requires the purchase of a Netica
API license from Norsys.  
  </p><p>
RNetica is now distributed in both source and object forms.
Note that because RNetica uses c code, it requires knowledge of how to
compile R packages.  Instructions can be found
at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.

</p>
<h1>CPTtools</h1>
<p>
Conditional Probability Table (CPT) Tools is a package of R functions
for constructing and manipulating conditional probability tables: one
of the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks.  The
tools were originally designed to work with StatShop (an internal
Bayesian network program developed at ETS), but they are general
enough to work with other Bayes net packages as well.  The versions
here are compatible with RNetica.  
  </p><p>
It also contains tools for displaying and analyzing the output of
Bayesian network analyses.  Again, the tools were originally designed
to work with the output of StatShop, but work equally well with
RNetica output.  Again, they should work with the output of other
Bayes net packages with minimal adaptation.
  </p><p>
CPTtools is beta release; however, the
code is all in R, and hence does not require advanced knowledge of R.

<h1>Peanut and PNetica</h1>
<p>
Peanut is an object oriented layer on top of CPTtools, for associating
choices of parameters and parameterizations with specific
parameterized nodes (Pnodes) in a parameterized network (Pnet).
Peanut is mostly a generic interface, and PNetica is a specific
implementation of the Peanut framework using RNetica.
  </p><p>
Peanut and PNetica are in early beta release; however, the
code is all in R, and hence does not require advanced knowledge of R.

<h1>Russell G Almond's utilities</h1>
<p> I've separated out a small collection of functions which I thought
  were generally useful, and not necessarily related to the Bayes net
  stuff into a <a href="RGAutils.html"><code>RGAutils</code></a>
  package. </p><p>

<h1>Proc4 Project</h1>
<p> I've started a new project implementing the four process
  architecture in R. This is available
  at <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/Proc4">https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/Proc4</a>.
  This includes the new rule based evidence identification system <code>EIEvent</code>.

<h2> RSS Feed</h2>
<p>After learning that people were scraping my site looking for new
releases, I've added an RSS feed.  The link
is <a href="RNeticaRSS.xml">RNeticaRSS</a>.

<h2> Sponsorship Information </h2>

<p>
Work on RNetica, CPTtools and Peanut has been sponsored in part by the
<i>Physics Playground</i> project, on which many of the tools were tested.
<i>Physics Playground</i> development was supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda
Gates Foundation grant <i>Games as Learning/Assessment:  Stealth
  Assessment</i> (#0PP1035331, Val Shute, PI) and the National Science
foundation grant <i>DIP: Game-based Assessment and Support of
  STEM-related Competencies</i> (#1628937, Val Shute, PI). The tool
development parts of each of these projects was led
by <a href="mailto:ralmond@fsu.edu">Russell Almond </a>.
