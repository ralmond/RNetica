  <h1>RNetica, PNetica, CPTtools and Peanut</h1>
  <p>
This website plays host to four different packages of functions useful
for building Bayesian networks:  <a href="RNetica.html">RNetica</a>,
<a href="CPTtools.html">CPTtools</a>, <a href="Peanut.html">PNetica and
  Peanut</a>.
<p>
RNetica and CPTtools are beta-quality releases and Peanut and PNetica
are both in early alpha stages.  There may be bugs and 
problmes and users should be comfortable debugging in R.  Although I
am happy to accept bug reports, I do not promise to respond to them in
a timely fashion.

<p>
Note that CPTtools is meant to be independent of the Bayes net
implementation and Peanut, the object oriented later on top of it,
depends on CPTtools but not the implementation specific packages.
RNetica depends on the Netica Bayes net engine and PNetica is the
Peanut implementation using RNetica.

<h1>About RNetica</h1>
<p>
RNetica is best thought of as a "glue" layer between the open source
statistical programming language
R <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>
and the proprietary Bayesian network engine
Netica &reg; <a href="http://www.norsys.com">http://www.norsys.com/</a>.
Doing non-trivial work with RNetica requries the purchase of a Netica
API license from Norsys.  
<p>
RNetica is now distributed in both source and object forms.
Note that because RNetica uses c code, it requires knowledge of how to
compile R packages.  Instructions can be found
at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.

<h1>CPTtools</h1>
<p>
Conditional Probability Table (CPT) Tools is a package of R functions
for constructing and manipulating conditional probability tables: one
fo the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks.  The
tools were originally designed to work with StatShop (an internal
Bayesian network program developed at ETS), but they are general
enough to work with other Bayes net packages as well.  The versions
here are compatable with RNetica.  
<p>
It also contains tools for displaying and analyzing the output of
Bayesian network analyses.  Again, the tools were originally designed
to work with the output of StatShop, but work equally well with
RNetica output.  Again, they should work with the output of other
Bayes net packages with minimal adaptation.
<p>
CPTtools is beta release; however, the
code is all in R, and hence does not require advanced knowledge of R.

<h1>Peanut and PNetica</h1>
<p>
Peanut is an object oriented layer on top of CPTtools, for associating
choices of parameters and parameterizations with specific
parameterized nodes (Pnodes) in a parameterized network (Pnet).
Peanut is mostly a generic interface, and PNetica is a specific
implemenation of the Peanut framework using RNetica.
<p>
Peanut and PNetica are in early beta release; however, the
code is all in R, and hence does not require advanced knowledge of R.
