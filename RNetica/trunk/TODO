Error message when NodeProbs() is called on a node whose CPT is not
yet set.


FALSE-node bug (Netica Node object is replaced with FALSE).
Nasty bug where RReference gets overwritten in network.  Not sure
where this is coming from, as they should be preserved.
      Nodelist <- NetworkNodesInSet(LevelMotif,"EMVars")
      NodeName(Nodelist$LeverTrohies) <- "LeverTrophies"
The corresponding element of the list is now FALSE and
    NetworkFindNode(LevelMotif,"LeverTrophies")
returns FALSE.
I'm having trouble reproducing this with a small example.  Maybe some
interaction with the garbage collector?  I've added a check for bad
object caches in the Net/Node/UserData field, now check to make sure
the returned object is of the right class, and if not recreates it.  I
wish I could more reliably reproduce the bugs so I can see if this
fixed the problem.
UPDATE:  I've made some changes that may fix this.  I've also now run
a couple of times using CHECK --gc-torture and not found the problem.
It may be fixed.

R stack error in BN_SetNodeProbs when passed a matrix of NA's as
probability table.

Ask Brent:
1. NodeLikelihood and MPE and FindingsProbability
2. IsNetCompiled function?
3. GetNodesets for Node, Nodes in NodeSet?
4. CopyNodes does not copy NodeSet information?
5. EnterLikelihoodFindingClique
6. NetworkUndo, Redo
7. Learn_CPTs return value?
